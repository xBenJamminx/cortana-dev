**Option 1 - Technical Focus:**

```
Built an intelligent model router that automatically picks the right AI for the job.

Simple question? → Gemini 3 Flash ($0.15/1M)
Debugging code? → Gemini 3 Pro ($3.50/1M)  
Designing systems? → GPT-5.2 ($1.75/1M)
100-page PDF? → Kimi K2.5 ($0.50/1M)

No more overpaying for simple tasks. No more underpowered models for complex work.

The router decides. You just ask.

**Option 2 - Story Focus (ACCURATE):**

```
I was using Claude Opus ($15/1M tokens) for EVERYTHING.

Simple queries. Complex debugging. Everything.

At volume, that adds up fast.

Built a router that picks the right model for the job:
⚡ Simple tasks → Gemini 3 Flash ($0.15/1M) - 99% cheaper
🔧 Complex tasks → Gemini 3 Pro ($3.50/1M) - 76% cheaper
🧠 Expert tasks → GPT-5.2 ($1.75/1M) - 88% cheaper
📄 Documents → Kimi ($0.50/1M) - 96% cheaper

~90% cost reduction at scale. Same (or better) results.

Stop paying Ferrari rates for grocery runs.

**Option 3 - Short & Punchy:**

```
Stop using one AI model for everything.

I built a router that picks the right brain for the job:

Simple → Cheap & fast
Complex → Powerful  
Expert → Deep reasoning
Documents → Long context

Results: 60% cheaper, 2x better outputs

Why I stopped using GPT-5.2 for everything (and built a model router instead)

The problem: I was paying premium prices for simple tasks.

"What's 2+2?" doesn't need frontier intelligence. But "Design a distributed system" absolutely does.

So I built an intelligent router that automatically classifies tasks and picks the right model:

🔹 Simple queries → Gemini 3 Flash ($0.15/1M tokens)
🔹 Complex debugging → Gemini 3 Pro ($3.50/1M)
🔹 Expert architecture → GPT-5.2 ($1.75/1M)
🔹 Document processing → Kimi K2.5 ($0.50/1M)

The impact:
• 60% cost reduction on daily workflows
• Better outputs (right tool for the job)
• Zero mental overhead (router decides automatically)

Sometimes the smartest move isn't picking the "best" model—it's picking the right one.

I built an AI that picks the right AI 🤖

Tired of overpaying for simple tasks, I created a model router that automatically chooses:

⚡ Simple stuff → Gemini 3 Flash (cheap & fast)
🔧 Complex code → Gemini 3 Pro (smart debugging)
🧠 Deep thinking → GPT-5.2 (best reasoning)
📄 Documents → Kimi (200K context window)

Result? 60% cheaper, better outputs, zero decision fatigue.

The future isn't one AI doing everything. It's the right AI for the right job.

I was hemorrhaging money on AI APIs.

Using GPT-5.2 for everything: $1.75/1M tokens × hundreds of requests = 💸💸💸

So I built an intelligent model router.

Here's how it works (and why it cut my costs by 60%):

🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The problem: Not all tasks need frontier intelligence.

"What is 2+2?" → Doesn't need GPT-5.2
"Debug this error" → Needs reasoning but not max power  
"Design a distributed system" → Needs the best model

One size fits all = wrong size for most.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
The solution: Classify first, route second.

My router analyzes each task and picks:

• Simple → Gemini 3 Flash ($0.15/1M)
• Complex → Gemini 3 Pro ($3.50/1M)
• Expert → GPT-5.2 ($1.75/1M)
• Documents → Kimi ($0.50/1M)

**Tweet 4:**
```
The logic is surprisingly simple:

Task length + keywords = classification

"What is..." → Simple
"Debug this..." → Complex  
"Design a system..." → Expert
"Summarize this PDF..." → Kimi

No ML required. Just smart heuristics.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Results after 1 week:

• 60% cost reduction
• Faster responses (lightweight models for light tasks)
• Better outputs (right tool for the job)

The "best" AI isn't always the most expensive one.

It's the right one.

Code dropping soon 👀
