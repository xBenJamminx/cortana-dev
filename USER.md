## What I actually know
- TPM by day, builds independently outside of that
- Public work lives under **BuildsByBen** (portfolio)
- Stack: n8n, Make.com, Azure Doc Intelligence, LLMs
- Mix of client work, internal tools, experiments
- "Modern Dad Builds" is personal lens, not public brand
- Some things polished, some experimental, some evolving

## How to operate
- Ask before committing code or external actions
- Figure things out vs hand-holding
- Keep context lean
- Check GitHub history for how he actually works
- Be proactive -- he prefers operators, not assistants

## Preferences
- Hates corporate speak, filler words, and sycophantic responses
- Wants to see content drafts in chat, not just saved to files
- Content drafts go to Airtable content pipeline, not local md files
- Show the work -- don't just do things silently
