## Major Pivot Day - X/Twitter Strategy

### Accounts
- **@BenJamminBuilds**: User's new builder-focused account (AI, automation, TPM). Bio finalized. Pivot announcement post drafted.
- **@CortanaOps**: My official X account (rebranded from @0xbenjammin). Bio and identity established.
- **@xBenJamminx**: Archive mode.

### X Bookmark Management System (Airtable)
- **Problem**: User has 1,385 X bookmarks, rarely revisits, needs better retrieval/prioritization.
- **Goal**: Fully automated, searchable, prioritizable storage of non-political bookmarks in Airtable.
- **Implementation**:
    - Full 1,385 bookmarks pulled from X.
    - New Airtable table "Bookmarks (Organized)" created with proper columns (Content, Author, Likes, Category, URL, Status, etc.).
    - Identified **76 truly political bookmarks** to be excluded.
    - Attempted to load 1,309 non-political bookmarks, but Airtable API has shown inconsistent behavior (records disappearing/not saving completely). This needs further troubleshooting.
- **Cron Jobs**:
    - Daily X bookmark sync (9 AM ET) set up.
    - Hourly qmd index update for local markdown notes.
- **Current State**: Airtable "Bookmarks (Organized)" table is not reliably populated. User has been asked to manually clear the table.

## Local Markdown Search (qmd)
- **qmd skill** installed and configured for `/root/clawd` (73 markdown files indexed).
- Hourly update cron job set up.

## Next Critical Action
- **User must manually clear all records from Airtable "Bookmarks (Organized)" table.**
- Once confirmed empty, I will re-attempt loading all 1,309 non-political bookmarks.
- After bookmark issue resolved, explore open-source Kimi-K2.5 model implementation.

## OpenRouter Smart Routing Setup (Claude Code helped)

### Model Configuration
Switched from burning $25/2 days on Kimi to smart auto-routing via OpenRouter.

**Guardrail: "Cortana Auto"** (ZDR Enforced)
- Gemini 3 Flash ($0.15/M) → simple tasks
- Kimi K2.5 ($0.50/M) → long context
- Gemini 3 Pro ($1.25/M) → coding + complex reasoning
- Claude Opus 4.5 ($15/M) → expert only (sparingly)
- Nano Banana Pro → image generation

### How It Works
- Model set to `openrouter/auto`
- OpenRouter analyzes each prompt and picks the cheapest capable model
- Guardrail restricts choices to only the models above
- No surprise $15 Opus bills on simple questions

### Aliases Available
- `gemini` → Gemini 3 Flash (default)
- `kimi` → Kimi K2.5
- `gemini3-pro` → Gemini 3 Pro
- `opus` → Claude Opus (manual only)
- `auto` → OpenRouter smart routing

### Why We Removed
- Sonnet → Gemini 3 Pro is better at coding AND cheaper
- Custom model_router.py → Couldn't integrate with clawdbot, OpenRouter does it better

### ZDR
Zero Data Retention enabled - prompts/responses not stored by OpenRouter.
