# BuildsByBen Community - Comprehensive Vision

## The One-Liner
AI for your whole life. Work, family, side projects, and the random stuff in between.

## The Pitch
"I'm a dad with two young kids, a full-time job, and a side consulting business. I use AI for all of it -- automating client work, building bedtime story generators for my sons, making Chrome extensions on weekends, analyzing fantasy football stats, and everything in between. This community is where I share what works, what doesn't, and how you can do it too."

## GOVERNING PRINCIPLES

### The Law
**"No repeated effort without capture."** Every piece of work Ben does gets documented, packaged, or turned into an asset. Nothing gets built once and forgotten.

### The Architecture
**"A library plus a room."** The community is two things: a growing library of assets (guides, prompts, templates, repos) and a room where people talk. The library compounds whether or not Ben is online. The room creates belonging.

### The Hierarchy
1. **Client work** (cash flow, case studies, proof)
2. **Community assets** (guides, templates, repos from that work)
3. **Community presence** (chat, calls, livestreams)
4. **Public content** (X, YouTube -- free funnel into the community)

This is the priority stack. When time is scarce, protect the top. The bottom feeds the top over time.

### The Progression
- **Phase 1:** You as proof (Ben's work IS the content)
- **Phase 2:** Artifacts as authority (library grows, speaks for itself)
- **Phase 3:** Community as system (members help each other, Ben curates and steers)

---

## WHO THIS IS FOR

**Busy, everyday people who know AI matters but don't have time to figure it all out.**

- The parent with 45 minutes after the kids are down
- The full-timer who wants to do more on the side but has limited hours
- The small business owner who knows AI can help but doesn't know where to start
- The side hustler trying to build something without a team or a CS degree
- The curious person who wants to use AI beyond basic ChatGPT prompts
- The marketer, teacher, freelancer, or creator who wants practical shortcuts

**NOT just for:**
- Silicon Valley techies
- Full-time indie hackers with unlimited time
- Enterprise executives
- Developers who live in VS Code

## WHO BEN IS

A 37-year-old dad in Long Island. Two young boys. Full-time job at a tech startup. Side consulting business (Parker & Taylor) doing AI automation for real companies. Builds products, tools, and experiments on the side -- some for business, some for fun, some for his family.

### What Ben Has Actually Built
**For clients:**
- Five Points OEMs -- document intelligence pipeline for automotive financial data
- Crowning Around -- podcast/brand site for Ms. New York Senior America
- Hannah Kroner -- personal brand portfolio
- Parker & Taylor -- boutique automation consultancy

**For family & fun:**
- PlayPal -- activity generator for parents (age-appropriate, low-effort ideas)
- Make It Mindful -- bedtime story generator with mindfulness focus
- Gather -- family birthday/playdate coordination app
- Haircut Generator -- AI hairstyle recommendations from a photo
- NFL Fun Stats -- fan-focused NFL analytics
- Flag Plays -- sports highlights and strategy

**Tools & open source:**
- BookmarkIQ -- Chrome extension to export/organize Twitter bookmarks (shipping Feb 2026)
- Retell -- AI video intelligence and repurposing tool (shipping Mar 2026)
- XDelete -- free script to delete all your tweets
- Smaug -- archive Twitter bookmarks to markdown
- AI Site Pilot -- AI chat widget that controls and navigates websites
- GitHub Heatmap Widget -- React component (open source)
- React Animated Highlighter -- GSAP animation component (open source)

**Creative/experimental:**
- Space Search -- spatial, metaphor-driven search interface
- Zen Particles -- interactive hand-tracking particle system
- Silverlake Media -- AI-operated digital media company
- Cortana (AI operator) -- personal AI system running 24/7 on a server

### What Ben does daily
- Researches AI tools, models, and trends
- Tests and compares new models as they drop
- Experiments with workflows and automations
- Operates AI systems for real business clients
- Builds products and tools with AI (using Claude Code, not traditional coding)
- Automates household things, builds stuff for his wife and kids
- Makes fun, random things when inspiration hits

**The brand is the range.** Not a specialist. A generalist who uses AI across every part of life and shares what actually works.

---

## THE FOUR PILLARS

1. **AI & Automation** -- tools, guides, experiments, roundups, news, model comparisons, what works and what's hype
2. **Solo Building** -- side projects, products, monetization, launching, growing, doing it without a team
3. **Mindful Fatherhood** -- using AI to get more done in less time so you can be present with family. Building things for your kids. Balancing ambition with presence.
4. **Real-Life Logs** -- the honest, unglamorous reality of juggling all of it. Wins, failures, lessons, the stuff nobody posts on LinkedIn.

---

## WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS

### The Primary Product
The community is not a side channel. It IS the business. Everything else (products, content, consulting) feeds into it and benefits from it.

### The Structure: Library + Room
Two parts that reinforce each other:
- **The Library** -- growing collection of guides, prompts, templates, repos. Compounds over time. Valuable even when Ben isn't online. This is the asset.
- **The Room** -- the chat, the calls, the livestreams. Where people connect, ask questions, share wins. This is the belonging.

### Priority Stack
1. Client work -- Five Points, Parker & Taylor (cash flow, case studies, proof of expertise)
2. Community assets -- guides, templates, repos extracted from real work (compounds whether or not Ben is online)
3. Community presence -- chat, calls, livestreams, member interaction (creates belonging)
4. Public content -- X, YouTube (free top of funnel, drives members)
5. Products -- BookmarkIQ, Retell, future builds (member perks, independent revenue)

### The Vibe
Not a corporate Slack. Not a hustle-bro Discord. A place that feels like hanging out with a smart friend who's a few steps ahead on AI. Sometimes it's serious (tool comparisons, workflow guides). Sometimes it's fun (I made my kid an AI bedtime story). Sometimes it's just people helping each other figure things out.

## PLATFORM: WHOP

- $0 upfront cost (pay only when you earn, 3% platform fee)

- Digital product sales alongside memberships

## PRICING

- **Standard: $49/mo** (after 50 founding members)

### Why This Pricing
- Machina charges $59/mo and hasn't launched yet

- $49 standard undercuts most AI communities ($59-99 range)
- When Skool migration happens, founding members get free lifetime access

### External Digital Products (sold individually on Whop, FREE for members)
| Product Type | Price Range | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt packs | $9-19 | Content Creator Pack, Competitor Research Pack, Product Builder Pack |
| Templates | $19-49 | Content OS, GTM Launch Kit, Product Spec Template, Competitive Analysis Framework |
| Mini-courses | $29-79 | "Build a Chrome Extension With AI", "Set Up Your AI Stack", "AI for Client Work" |

**The bundle pitch:** "Join for $29/mo and get $300+ in digital products free." Makes membership feel like a steal.

## PARTNER & AFFILIATE STRATEGY

### The Triple Win
- Ben gets affiliate revenue and/or sponsor fees
- Members get exclusive discounts on tools they'd buy anyway
- AI companies get distribution through a trusted community

### Phase 1: Tools Ben Already Uses (launch month)
| Tool | Relationship | Ask |
|---|---|---|
| Composio | Wrote article, daily user | Affiliate link + member discount |
| ElevenLabs | Voice integration, daily user | Affiliate link + extended trial |
| Vercel | Hosting products | Affiliate link |
| Clerk | Auth for products | Affiliate link + startup credits |

### Phase 2: Tools Reviewed in Content (months 2-6)
- Review a tool on YouTube/X
- Negotiate affiliate + member discount as part of the review
- Honest review regardless (trust > money)

### Phase 3: Inbound (as audience grows)
- Companies reach out for distribution through the community
- Negotiate: flat sponsor fee + affiliate + member discount
- Only partner with tools Ben genuinely recommends

### Revenue from Partnerships
- Conservative: $500-1,500/mo (5 deals)
- Growth: $2,000-5,000/mo (10+ deals, sponsor fees)
- Pure margin on top of membership and product revenue

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY (Feeds the Community)

### Public Content (Free, Grows Audience)

**X Posts (2/week minimum):**
- Tool tips, contrarian takes, quick lists, numbers + insights
- Post templates that work: free tool announcements, research posts, stat + take, lessons learned
- Every post is about the READER's problem, not Ben's product

**YouTube (1 video every 2 weeks):**
- Tool reviews and comparisons (15-20 min)
- Model comparisons (Opus vs Codex, etc.)
- How-to tutorials in plain English
- Record Wednesday, edit Friday, upload Tuesday

**YouTube Shorts (1/week):**
- Clipped from longer video or quick 60s take on news
- Fire when big AI news drops

**X Articles (biweekly):**
- Deeper pieces using the Machina formula: solve a real problem, soft CTA for community underneath
- "How to organize 1,000 Twitter bookmarks without paying $10/mo" -> CTA for community

### Private Content (Community-Exclusive)
- Full guides with prompts, configs, step-by-step
- Extended cuts of YouTube videos (the parts cut from public version)
- Livestreams and build sessions
- Tool deals and alerts
- Monthly AMA recordings

### The Line Between Free and Paid
- **Free:** "Here's the concept, the approach, the what and why"
- **Paid:** "Here's my exact prompt, config, walkthrough, and the support to help you do it"
