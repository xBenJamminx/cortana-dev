# BuildsByBen Product Map

**Last updated:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** Draft v1 -- awaiting Ben's approval on structure

## Positioning

**Tagline:** AI for your whole life.
**Core promise:** Learn to use AI effectively -- whether that means running your business smarter, building a side project, or making family life easier.
**Differentiator:** Not "learn AI from zero." Not "build an AI agency." Practical AI for everyday people who want results. Taught by someone who uses it across work, side projects, and family life.
**Audience (primary):** Business owners + side hustlers. Parents = part of Ben's brand, not a target segment.

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Their Lane | Our Lane |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Nate Herk / AIS | n8n automation + agency building | AI for your whole life (not just automation) |
| Skill Leap AI | Beginner tool tutorials | Practical outcomes, not tool walkthroughs |
| God of Prompt | Prompt marketplace | Curated, contextual prompts with real use cases |
| Liam Ottley | AI agency business model | Not agency-focused. For people who use AI, not sell AI. |
| Generic Gumroad sellers | 5,000 padded prompts for $10 | Quality over quantity. 15 prompts that actually work > 5,000 that don't. |

## Key Decisions Needed from Ben

1. ~~Community platform: Skool vs Discord vs Circle vs other?~~ **DECIDED: Whop + Discord** (see whop-setup-guide.md)
2. Launch digital products first (Gumroad) or community first?
3. Which prompt packs should I build first?
4. Video tutorials or written-only for now?
5. Newsletter tool preference? (Beehiiv, ConvertKit, Substack?)
