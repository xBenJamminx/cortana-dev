## 1. Tweet/X Post from a Lesson, Insight, or Experience

**Category:** Social Media

**Best Model:** Claude

**When to Use:** You just learned something the hard way, shipped something, or had a realization worth sharing, and you want a single punchy post.

**The Prompt:**

```
Write a single tweet (under 280 characters) based on this lesson or insight:

[DESCRIBE THE LESSON, INSIGHT, OR EXPERIENCE IN 1-3 SENTENCES]

Context about me: [YOUR ROLE / WHAT YOU BUILD / YOUR NICHE]

Rules:
- Write in first person, casual and direct
- No hashtags
- No "I just realized..." or "Here's what I learned..." openers
- Start with the insight itself, not the backstory
- Make it feel like something you'd say to a friend, not a keynote audience
- No corporate words like "leverage," "utilize," "optimize," or "harness"
- No em dashes
- Give me 3 variations: one confrontational/contrarian, one observational, one practical
```

**Example Use Case:** You spent two weeks building a feature nobody used. You want to turn that into a post about building what people ask for vs. what you assume they want.

**Pro Tip:** The confrontational variation almost always performs best on X. People engage with disagreement more than agreement. Pick that one unless it feels forced.

## 2. Twitter/X Thread from a Long Piece or Topic

**Category:** Social Media

**Best Model:** Claude

**When to Use:** You have a blog post, project recap, or deep topic and want to break it into a thread that people actually read to the end.

**The Prompt:**

```
Turn the following content into a Twitter/X thread of 5-8 tweets.

SOURCE MATERIAL:
[PASTE YOUR BLOG POST, NOTES, OR DETAILED TOPIC DESCRIPTION]

Rules:
- Tweet 1 is the hook. It must create curiosity or make a bold claim. No "Thread:" or "A thread on..." labels.
- Each tweet should stand alone but flow naturally into the next
- Use short sentences. One idea per tweet.
- Include at least one specific number, result, or concrete detail
- No hashtags anywhere in the thread
- No emojis
- No em dashes
- Last tweet should be a takeaway or CTA, not a summary
- Write in first person, conversational tone
- Avoid words like "game-changer," "powerful," "incredible," "leverage," or "unlock"
- Each tweet must be under 280 characters

Also give me an alternative hook tweet (Tweet 1) that takes a completely different angle.
```

**Example Use Case:** You wrote a 1,500-word blog post about setting up an AI automation that saves you 3 hours a week. You want to turn it into a thread that drives traffic back to the full piece.

**Pro Tip:** Post the hook tweet first, wait 2-3 minutes to see if it gets early traction, then reply with the rest of the thread. If the hook falls flat, delete and try the alternative hook later that day.

---

## 3. Blog Post Outline from a Rough Topic

**Category:** Long-form

**Best Model:** Claude

**When to Use:** You have a vague topic in your head but staring at a blank doc isn't producing anything. You need structure before you write.

**The Prompt:**

```
Create a detailed blog post outline for the following topic:

TOPIC: [YOUR TOPIC OR ROUGH IDEA]

TARGET READER: [WHO IS THIS FOR -- e.g., "solo founders building SaaS products" or "parents learning AI tools"]

GOAL OF THE POST: [WHAT SHOULD THE READER KNOW OR DO AFTER READING -- e.g., "understand how to set up their first automation" or "feel confident picking an AI writing tool"]

Rules:
- Start with a working title (make it specific, not clever)
- Write a 2-sentence summary of the post's core argument
- Create 5-7 main sections with H2 headings
- Under each H2, include 2-4 bullet points describing what that section covers
- Include a suggested opening paragraph that hooks with a real scenario, not a definition
- Include a suggested closing paragraph with a clear next step for the reader
- Flag any sections where a screenshot, example, or data point would strengthen the argument
- Don't use filler sections like "Why This Matters" or "The Future of X" unless they add real value
- Tone: practical, direct, written by someone who's done the thing
- No corporate jargon. Write for humans.
```

**Example Use Case:** You want to write a post about using AI to repurpose one video into a week of content, but you don't know where to start or how to structure it.

**Pro Tip:** After getting the outline, go through it and delete any section where you don't have a real example or opinion. A shorter post with substance beats a long post with filler every time.

---

## 4. Weekly Newsletter Draft from Notes/Bullets

**Category:** Email

**Best Model:** Claude

**When to Use:** It's newsletter day and you have a pile of bullet points, links, and half-thoughts. You need them turned into something people want to read.

**The Prompt:**

```
Write a weekly newsletter issue based on my raw notes below.

NEWSLETTER NAME: [YOUR NEWSLETTER NAME]
MY NAME: [YOUR NAME]
AUDIENCE: [WHO READS THIS -- e.g., "indie hackers and AI builders"]
TONE: [e.g., "casual and direct, like a smart friend updating you over coffee"]

RAW NOTES / BULLETS:
[PASTE YOUR BULLET POINTS, LINKS, OBSERVATIONS, HALF-FORMED THOUGHTS]

Structure it as:
1. Opening (2-3 sentences) -- start with the most interesting thing from this week. No "Happy Monday!" or "Welcome back!" openers.
2. Main story or insight (150-250 words) -- the meatiest item from my notes, expanded into a short narrative with a takeaway.
3. Quick hits (3-5 items) -- short bullets covering the remaining notes. Each one: bold label, then 1-2 sentence summary with context on why it matters.
4. One thing I'm thinking about -- a question, observation, or open-ended thought to end on. Invite replies.

Rules:
- Write in first person
- Keep total length under 600 words
- No em dashes
- No emojis
- No filler. If a bullet from my notes isn't interesting enough, drop it.
- Sound like a person, not a publication
- Every link should have context (don't just say "check this out")
```

**Example Use Case:** You have 8 bullet points from the week: a tool you tried, a thread that blew up, a client win, a mistake you made, two articles you read. You need it shaped into a newsletter in 10 minutes.

**Pro Tip:** Write your opening line yourself and paste it in with the notes. The AI will match your voice better when it has a real sample of how you actually write.

## 5. YouTube Video Script from a Concept

**Category:** Video

**Best Model:** ChatGPT-4o

**When to Use:** You know what your video is about but need a script structure that keeps viewers watching, not a wall of text you'll never follow.

**The Prompt:**

```
Write a YouTube video script based on this concept:

VIDEO TOPIC: [YOUR VIDEO IDEA]
TARGET VIEWER: [WHO IS THIS FOR]
VIDEO LENGTH: [TARGET MINUTES -- e.g., "8-10 minutes"]
MY STYLE: [e.g., "talking head with screen recordings" or "casual, sitting at desk"]

Structure:

HOOK (first 15 seconds):
- Open with a bold statement, surprising fact, or relatable problem
- No "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel"
- Tell them exactly what they'll get from this video in one sentence

SETUP (30-60 seconds):
- Brief context on why this topic matters right now
- Establish credibility without bragging (mention experience naturally)

MAIN CONTENT (broken into 3-5 sections):
- For each section, write:
  - A transition sentence from the previous section
  - The key point in 2-3 sentences (spoken, not written)
  - A specific example, story, or demonstration note
  - A retention hook at the end of the section ("but here's where it gets interesting..." or similar)

CLOSE (30-45 seconds):
- Recap the single most important takeaway
- Clear CTA (one thing to do, not three)
- End with energy, not "anyway, that's it"

Rules:
- Write for speaking, not reading. Short sentences. Conversational.
- Include [SCREEN RECORDING] or [B-ROLL] markers where visuals should change
- No corporate language
- No em dashes
- No filler phrases ("without further ado," "in this video we're going to")
- Write like the creator is talking to one person, not an audience
```

**Example Use Case:** You want to make a video showing how you use AI to go from a single blog post to 10 pieces of content. You need a script that keeps it tight and watchable.

**Pro Tip:** Read the script out loud before recording. If any sentence feels unnatural to say, rewrite it. Written-for-reading and written-for-speaking are two different things.

## 6. LinkedIn Post from a Build Log or Work Update

**Category:** Social Media

**Best Model:** Claude

**When to Use:** You shipped something, finished a project, or hit a milestone at work and want to post about it on LinkedIn without sounding like every other "I'm humbled to announce" post.

**The Prompt:**

```
Write a LinkedIn post based on this work update:

WHAT HAPPENED: [DESCRIBE WHAT YOU BUILT, SHIPPED, OR ACCOMPLISHED]
THE BACKSTORY: [ANY RELEVANT CONTEXT -- what problem it solves, how long it took, what went wrong]
THE RESULT: [ANY NUMBERS, OUTCOMES, OR FEEDBACK]

My role/title: [YOUR ROLE]
My industry: [YOUR INDUSTRY OR NICHE]

Rules:
- Opening line must stop the scroll. No "I'm excited to share..." or "Thrilled to announce..."
- Keep it under 200 words (LinkedIn truncates at ~210 words before "see more")
- Use line breaks between ideas (LinkedIn rewards whitespace)
- Include one honest/vulnerable moment (what was hard, what you'd do differently)
- End with a question or observation, not a CTA to "like and follow"
- No em dashes
- No emojis
- No hashtags
- First person, direct tone
- Don't use "journey," "passionate," "grateful," or "humbled"
- Write like you're telling a coworker about your week, not presenting at a conference

Give me 2 versions: one that leads with the result, one that leads with the problem you were solving.
```

**Example Use Case:** You just launched an internal tool that cut your team's reporting time from 4 hours to 20 minutes. You want to post about it without it reading like a press release.

**Pro Tip:** The version that leads with the problem almost always performs better on LinkedIn. People relate to problems before they care about solutions.

## 7. Content Calendar Generator (Weekly or Monthly)

**Category:** Planning

**Best Model:** Claude

**When to Use:** You need to plan your content for the week or month and want a structured calendar instead of winging it every morning.

**The Prompt:**

```
Create a [WEEKLY / MONTHLY] content calendar for me.

PLATFORMS I POST ON: [e.g., "X/Twitter daily, LinkedIn 3x/week, YouTube 1x/week, newsletter 1x/week"]
MY NICHE/TOPIC: [WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT]
CURRENT PROJECTS OR THEMES: [WHAT YOU'RE WORKING ON OR WANT TO PROMOTE]
CONTENT I ALREADY HAVE: [ANY EXISTING POSTS, ARTICLES, VIDEOS YOU CAN REPURPOSE -- or "starting from scratch"]

For each content piece, provide:
- Day and platform
- Content type (post, thread, video, newsletter, etc.)
- Topic/angle in one sentence
- Source (is this original, repurposed from something, or riffing on a trend?)
- Estimated creation time (5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr)

Rules:
- Batch similar content types together (don't scatter threads across the week)
- No more than 45 minutes total content creation per day
- Include at least 2 repurposed pieces per week (don't create everything from scratch)
- Mix content types: some teaching, some storytelling, some opinion, some showing work
- Leave one "reactive" slot per week for jumping on trending topics
- No em dashes
- No filler content. Every piece should have a clear reason to exist.
- Add a "content bank" section at the bottom with 5 backup ideas I can swap in if something doesn't feel right

Format as a clean table.
```

**Example Use Case:** You post on X daily and LinkedIn 3 times a week, plus a weekly newsletter. You're launching a new tool this month and want your content to build toward the launch without being repetitive.

**Pro Tip:** Don't fill every slot on day one. Plan 70% of your calendar and leave 30% open. The best content comes from real-time reactions to things that happen during the week.

## 8. Repurpose Long-form Content into Short-form Pieces

**Category:** Repurposing

**Best Model:** Claude

**When to Use:** You have a blog post, video transcript, podcast episode, or newsletter and want to extract every piece of short-form content hiding inside it.

**The Prompt:**

```
I have a piece of long-form content. Extract every possible short-form content piece from it.

SOURCE CONTENT:
[PASTE YOUR FULL BLOG POST, TRANSCRIPT, OR NEWSLETTER]

PLATFORMS I NEED CONTENT FOR: [e.g., "X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram captions"]

For each piece you extract, provide:
1. Platform it's best suited for
2. Content type (single post, thread, carousel concept, quote graphic text, short video script hook)
3. The actual written content, ready to post (not a summary of what to write)
4. Which section of the original it came from

Rules:
- Find the non-obvious pieces, not just the main points. Look for: surprising stats, contrarian takes, quotable one-liners, "I wish I knew this sooner" moments, before/after comparisons, mistakes made
- Each piece must stand completely on its own. Someone who never read the original should understand it.
- Minimum 8 pieces, maximum 15
- No em dashes
- No emojis
- No hashtags
- No "As I mentioned in my recent post..." references
- Vary the formats. Don't give me 10 tweets that all sound the same.
- For each piece, rate its potential engagement: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW and briefly say why
```

**Example Use Case:** You published a 2,000-word blog post about your first year as a solo founder. You want to extract a week's worth of social content from it instead of writing new stuff every day.

**Pro Tip:** The highest-performing repurposed pieces are usually not the main thesis of the original. They're the throwaway lines, the side stories, the specific numbers buried in paragraph four. Pay attention to the ones the AI flags as HIGH engagement.

## 9. SEO-Optimized Title and Meta Description

**Category:** SEO

**Best Model:** Any

**When to Use:** You're publishing a blog post or landing page and need a title and meta description that rank AND get clicks.

**The Prompt:**

```
Write SEO-optimized title tags and meta descriptions for this content:

CONTENT TOPIC: [WHAT THE PAGE IS ABOUT]
TARGET KEYWORD: [THE PRIMARY KEYWORD YOU WANT TO RANK FOR]
SECONDARY KEYWORDS: [2-3 RELATED KEYWORDS -- optional]
SEARCH INTENT: [WHAT IS THE PERSON SEARCHING FOR THIS ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO -- e.g., "learn how to," "compare options," "find the best tool"]
PAGE TYPE: [blog post / landing page / product page / tutorial]

Provide:
- 5 title tag options (under 60 characters each, keyword near the front)
- 3 meta description options (under 155 characters each, include a reason to click)

Rules:
- Titles should be specific, not generic. "How to Automate Invoice Processing with AI in 2026" beats "AI Automation Guide"
- Include the target keyword naturally, not forced
- Meta descriptions should answer: why should I click THIS result instead of the others?
- At least one title should include a number
- At least one title should include a year
- No clickbait. No "You Won't Believe..."
- No em dashes in titles or descriptions
- No emojis
- Write for humans first, search engines second
- After the options, recommend your top title + description combo and explain why in one sentence
```

**Example Use Case:** You wrote a tutorial on setting up AI-powered email automation for freelancers. You need a title and meta description that compete on page one.

**Pro Tip:** Search your target keyword on Google before running this prompt. Look at what the top 5 results use for their titles, then paste those into the prompt as context. The AI can then write titles that stand out from what already ranks.

## 10. Email Subject Line A/B Test Variations

**Category:** Email

**Best Model:** Any

**When to Use:** You're sending a newsletter or email campaign and want subject lines that actually get opened, plus a testing plan.

**The Prompt:**

```
Generate email subject line variations for A/B testing.

EMAIL CONTENT SUMMARY: [1-2 SENTENCES ABOUT WHAT THE EMAIL CONTAINS]
AUDIENCE: [WHO'S RECEIVING THIS]
EMAIL TYPE: [newsletter / product launch / welcome sequence / re-engagement / promotion]
TONE: [e.g., "casual and direct" or "professional but warm"]

Give me 10 subject line options organized into these categories:

CURIOSITY (3 options):
- Make the reader wonder what's inside without being clickbait

DIRECT VALUE (3 options):
- Tell them exactly what they get by opening

PERSONAL/STORY (2 options):
- Feel like a message from a real person, not a brand

CONTRARIAN/UNEXPECTED (2 options):
- Challenge an assumption or say something surprising

For each subject line:
- Keep it under 50 characters (shows fully on mobile)
- No em dashes
- No emojis
- No ALL CAPS words
- No spam trigger words ("free," "guaranteed," "act now")

Then recommend your top 2 picks for an A/B test and explain the hypothesis: what you're testing and why those two create a meaningful comparison.
```

**Example Use Case:** Your weekly newsletter this week covers a new AI tool review, a personal story about a failed launch, and 3 quick links. You need subject lines that stand out in a crowded inbox.

**Pro Tip:** Always A/B test a curiosity line against a direct value line. That comparison teaches you whether your audience opens for mystery or for clarity. Once you know, you can stop guessing.

## 11. Hook/Opening Line Generator for Any Platform

**Category:** Social Media / Long-form

**Best Model:** Claude

**When to Use:** You know what you want to say but can't nail the first line. The hook determines whether anyone reads the rest.

**The Prompt:**

```
Generate 10 opening hooks for this content:

CONTENT TOPIC: [WHAT THIS PIECE IS ABOUT]
PLATFORM: [X/Twitter, LinkedIn, blog post, YouTube, newsletter, Instagram]
KEY POINT: [THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE]
TARGET READER: [WHO SHOULD STOP SCROLLING FOR THIS]

Give me hooks in these styles:

1. Bold claim -- state something confidently that makes people want to agree or argue
2. Specific number -- lead with a surprising stat or result
3. Question -- ask something the reader has wondered but hasn't articulated
4. Contrast -- "Most people do X. Here's why Y works better."
5. Story entry -- drop the reader into a specific moment ("Last Tuesday at 2am, I...")
6. Confession -- admit something unexpected or counterintuitive
7. Pattern interrupt -- say something that doesn't sound like typical content in this niche
8. Problem statement -- name the pain directly and specifically
9. Hot take -- a genuine opinion that's slightly uncomfortable to say
10. Simple and clear -- just say the thing, no tricks, pure clarity

Rules:
- Every hook must be under 20 words (shorter is better)
- No em dashes
- No emojis
- No "In today's world..." or "Have you ever wondered..." or "Let me tell you..."
- Each hook should be able to stand completely alone as a first impression
- Write them in my voice: [DESCRIBE YOUR VOICE IN 3-5 WORDS -- e.g., "blunt, practical, slightly funny"]

After the 10 hooks, pick your top 3 and rank them by likely engagement on [PLATFORM]. One sentence each on why.
```

**Example Use Case:** You're writing a LinkedIn post about how you automated half your client reporting with AI. You have the whole post drafted but the opening line is boring.

**Pro Tip:** Write your post first with a placeholder opening. Then run this prompt. It's easier to pick the right hook when you already know what it's hooking into.

---

## 12. "Lessons Learned" Post from a Project or Experience

**Category:** Social Media / Long-form

**Best Model:** Claude

**When to Use:** You just finished a project, closed a chapter, or hit a milestone and want to share what you actually learned, not just what happened.

**The Prompt:**

```
Write a "lessons learned" post based on this experience:

THE EXPERIENCE: [DESCRIBE WHAT YOU DID, BUILT, OR WENT THROUGH]
TIMELINE: [HOW LONG DID IT TAKE]
WHAT WENT WELL: [LIST THE WINS]
WHAT WENT WRONG: [LIST THE MISTAKES OR SURPRISES]
WHAT YOU'D DO DIFFERENTLY: [IF YOU STARTED OVER TOMORROW]
THE AUDIENCE: [WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM HEARING THIS]
PLATFORM: [X thread / LinkedIn / blog post / newsletter]

Rules:
- Lead with the most surprising or counterintuitive lesson, not the most obvious
- Structure as [NUMBER] lessons, each one 2-3 sentences max
- Each lesson needs: the lesson itself (bold), then the context/story that proves it
- Include at least one lesson that's about something that went wrong
- Include at least one lesson that contradicts common advice in your space
- Don't sanitize. The honest, slightly uncomfortable lessons are the ones people remember.
- No em dashes
- No emojis
- No "Here are my top takeaways" framing. Start with the first lesson directly.
- End with a single forward-looking statement: what you're doing next because of these lessons
- Tone: reflective but not self-important. You learned something, you're sharing it, move on.

Format for [PLATFORM]:
- If X thread: each lesson = one tweet, keep under 280 chars
- If LinkedIn: single post, line breaks between lessons, under 300 words total
- If blog post: expand each lesson to a full paragraph with examples
- If newsletter: conversational tone, 400-600 words, include personal asides
```

**Example Use Case:** You just wrapped up 6 months of building a SaaS product as a solo founder. You got 200 users, made $1,400 in revenue, and learned more from your mistakes than your wins. You want to share the real story.

**Pro Tip:** Write your "what went wrong" list before your "what went well" list. The failures are where the real lessons live, and they're the ones people will share. Anyone can post about wins. Useful honesty about failures is rare and it builds trust fast.

## How to Get the Most Out of These Prompts

**Start with one.** Don't try to run all 12 in a day. Pick the one that solves your most immediate problem and use it this week.

**Customize the voice.** Every prompt includes tone instructions, but you should add your own. Paste in a sample of your actual writing and tell the AI to match it. The more context about your voice, the less editing you'll do after.

**Edit the output.** These prompts get you 80% there. The last 20% is you adding the details, stories, and opinions that only you have. AI is the engine. You're the driver.

**Save your best results.** When a prompt produces something great, save the output as a reference. Next time you run that prompt, include it as a "write in this style" example. The quality compounds.

**Combine prompts.** The real power move: use Prompt 3 (blog outline) to write a post, then feed it into Prompt 8 (repurpose) to get a week of social content, then use Prompt 11 (hooks) to sharpen every opening line. One input, dozens of outputs.
