## Post 1: Tool Tip / How-To (Practical AI Advice)

**Hook type:** Immediate utility

> Most people paste entire documents into ChatGPT and wonder why the output is mid.
>
> Try this instead: pull out the 3 sentences that actually matter, then ask for analysis on just those.
>
> Smaller, sharper input = dramatically better output. LLMs don't reward you for volume. They reward you for clarity.

**Format:** Single post (278 chars)
**Why it works:** Solves a universal beginner mistake. No product, no brand, just a tip someone can use in 30 seconds.

## Post 2: Contrarian Take / Observation

**Hook type:** Pattern interrupt

> Hot take: the best AI automations I've built replaced 20-minute tasks, not 4-hour workflows.
>
> Everyone chases the big dramatic transformation. But a 20-minute task that runs 11 times a week? That's 190 hours a year. Quietly life-changing.
>
> Stop hunting whales. Automate the mosquitoes.

**Format:** Single post (280 chars)
**Why it works:** Goes against the "automate everything" narrative. Grounded in real math. The metaphor lands without being cute.

## Post 3: Numbers + Insight (Stat-Driven)

**Hook type:** Surprising number

> I tracked every AI tool I actually used over 30 days.
>
> Started with 14 paid subscriptions.
> Actively used 4.
> Could have done 90% of my work with 2.
>
> The AI tool stack most people need:
> - One LLM (ChatGPT or Claude)
> - One automation layer (Make, n8n, or Zapier)
>
> That's it. The rest is shelfware with a monthly fee.

**Format:** Short thread (2 tweets)
**Tweet 1:** "I tracked every AI tool I actually used over 30 days." through "Actively used 4."
**Tweet 2:** "Could have done 90% of my work with 2." through end.
**Why it works:** Specific numbers from real experience. Saves people money. Contrarian enough to spark replies.

## Post 4: Lesson Learned (From Real Experience)

**Hook type:** Vulnerable admission

> Spent 3 weeks building a custom AI pipeline that a single Zapier zap could have handled.
>
> The lesson: your first instinct as a builder is to build. But the right move is usually to duct-tape something ugly together, see if anyone cares, then build only if they do.
>
> Engineering time is the most expensive resource you have. Spend it after validation, not before.

**Format:** Single post (280 chars) or 2-tweet thread
**Tweet 1:** "Spent 3 weeks building a custom AI pipeline..." through "...see if anyone cares, then build only if they do."
**Tweet 2:** "Engineering time is the most expensive resource you have. Spend it after validation, not before."
**Why it works:** Relatable builder mistake. The advice applies to anyone shipping anything, not just AI people.

## Notes

- Zero product mentions. Zero CTAs. Week 1 is about earning attention, not converting it.
- If any post gets above-average engagement, lean into that format for week 2.
- All posts pass the "stranger test": someone with zero context about Ben gets full value.
