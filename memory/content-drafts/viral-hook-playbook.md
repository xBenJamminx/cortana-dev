## The 7 Hook Patterns That Stop Scrolling

1. **Curiosity gap**: "Most people don't know this about [X], but..." -- brain can't leave a gap open
2. **Contrarian**: "[Common belief] is wrong." -- triggers "prove it" instinct, people engage to argue or agree
3. **Specific number + outcome**: "I went from [bad] to [good] in [timeframe]" -- specificity = credibility
4. **Direct address**: "If you're [situation], this is for you" -- self-selection, right people stop immediately
5. **Story opener**: A moment in time. "Three years ago I [X]. Last week I [Y]." -- humans are wired for narrative
6. **Insider secret**: "Nobody talks about this, but..." -- same psychology as the watchdog hook
7. **Urgency/threat**: "You're probably making this mistake right now" -- fear of loss > desire for gain

## Why the Watchdog Post Crushed It (67 likes, 109 bookmarks in under 2 hours)

Hook: "There's a problem nobody warns you about with @OpenClaw bots."

Combined three patterns at once:
- Direct address (OpenClaw users self-select)
- Insider secret ("nobody warns you")
- Threat (your bot is down and you don't know)

Bookmark-to-like ratio was almost 2:1. When bookmarks outpace likes, the content is so useful people quietly save it instead of just engaging.

## What Made It Work Beyond the Hook

- **Problem first, solution second.** Named the exact pain before offering anything.
- **First person, real experience.** "I didn't know my gateway went down 3 times last week" -- not generic advice.
- **"Steal this prompt" as the payoff.** Everything above it is setup. By the time you get to the prompt, you'd feel stupid not to copy it.
- **Effortless tone.** No "10 minutes." No "step by step." Just paste it, your bot does the rest.
- **Niche > broad.** Targeted a specific community with a specific pain point vs. trying to appeal to everyone.

## Post Structure Template

```
[One-line hook -- pattern 1, 6, or 7 work best for our niche]

[2-3 sentences describing the pain. Make it visceral. They should nod.]

[1 sentence: what you did about it]

[How it works -- keep it dead simple, no numbered tutorial]

[Social proof line -- real numbers, real experience]

[Steal this prompt / CTA]

[Closer -- one line, confident]
```

## Key Rules (Ben's Feedback)

- Hook must be ONE line, short
- Don't make it about "I" -- make it about what THEY can do
- Don't make things seem harder than they are
- No step-by-step instructions when the prompt does the work
- Claude Code or the bot itself -- NOT regular Claude/ChatGPT
- First person perspective for the story, but frame the value for them
- Keep it short. If it feels long, it is.

## Hook Bank for Future Posts

### Tested hooks:
- "There's a problem nobody warns you about with [X]." (PROVEN -- watchdog post)

### Untested hooks for upcoming posts:
- "You don't need a terminal to deploy an app anymore."
- "Your @OpenClaw bot forgets everything between sessions."
- "You have no idea what your @OpenClaw bot is actually doing."
- "Your @OpenClaw bot can't reach you outside of chat."
- "Stop copy-pasting deploy commands. Your bot can do it."

## Miles Deutscher Psychology Breakdown

Structure: pattern interrupt > stakes before substance > simple system > concrete numbers > prompt as payoff

Why it works:
1. Acknowledges the noise, positions himself as the signal
2. Creates emotional investment before showing anything
3. 3 simple steps builds trust that he knows what he's talking about
4. "1 per week, 4 in a month, 12 in 3 months" -- outcome feels inevitable
5. By the time you reach the prompt, you'd be stupid not to copy it

Key difference: Miles targets millions of general AI-curious people. Our posts target a specific niche. "There's a problem nobody warns you about" beats "this is the only post that matters" for niche audiences because it triggers curiosity in the RIGHT people.
