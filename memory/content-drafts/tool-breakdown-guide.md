# The AI Tools I Actually Use (And Pay For)

**By Ben Jammin | BuildsByBen**

There are thousands of AI tools. I've tried hundreds. I pay for about a dozen. Here's the honest breakdown of what's in my stack, what each one costs, and whether it's worth it for you.

No affiliate links. No sponsorships. Just what works.

## 1. Claude (Anthropic)

**What it is:** Large language model. My primary AI for everything from writing to coding to research.

**What I pay:** $20/mo (Pro) / Claude Max for heavy usage

**What I use it for:**
- Writing client proposals, emails, and documentation
- Coding entire applications (with Claude Code CLI)
- Research and analysis
- Content creation and editing
- Running Cortana, my AI operator that manages automations 24/7

**Verdict:** This is the one tool I could not work without. Claude's writing quality is noticeably better than the alternatives. Claude Code (the CLI tool) lets me build full applications by describing what I want. I've shipped multiple products this way.

**Who it's for:** Anyone who writes, codes, or thinks for a living. The free tier is fine for casual use. Pro is worth it the moment you hit the free limits more than twice a week.

**Alternative:** ChatGPT if you prefer the ecosystem. Gemini if you need massive context windows.

## 2. ChatGPT (OpenAI)

**What it is:** The AI everyone knows. Large language model with image generation, browsing, and plugins.

**What I pay:** $20/mo (Plus)

**What I use it for:**
- Quick questions where I don't need Claude's depth
- Image generation with DALL-E
- Voice conversations (mobile app)
- When I want a second opinion on something Claude wrote

**Verdict:** Still useful, but it's my secondary model now. The browsing feature is handy. Voice mode on mobile is genuinely useful for thinking out loud while driving. Image generation is convenient but not best-in-class.

**Who it's for:** Good starting point if you're new to AI. The free tier is generous. Worth paying for if you use it daily.

**Alternative:** Claude for better writing and reasoning. Gemini for Google integration.

## 3. Google Gemini

**What it is:** Google's AI model. Strong at research, massive context window, deep Google integration.

**What I pay:** Included with Google One AI Premium ($20/mo) / API access via Google AI Studio (free tier)

**What I use it for:**
- Processing extremely long documents (Gemini handles 1M+ tokens)
- Image generation (Imagen)
- When I need something grounded in Google Search results
- API calls in my automation workflows (cost-effective for bulk processing)

**Verdict:** The context window is the killer feature. If you need to analyze a 200-page PDF or a full codebase, Gemini handles it where others choke. The API pricing is also significantly cheaper than OpenAI for high-volume tasks.

**Who it's for:** Power users who work with long documents. Developers who need cheap API access. Anyone deep in the Google ecosystem.

**Alternative:** Claude for writing quality. ChatGPT for general use.

## 4. Cursor

**What it is:** AI-powered code editor. VS Code fork with AI built into every interaction.

**What I pay:** $20/mo (Pro)

**What I use it for:**
- Building web applications (React, Node, SvelteKit)
- Debugging code
- Understanding unfamiliar codebases
- Rapid prototyping

**Verdict:** If you write code, this is a must-have. It's not magic, but it cuts development time by 40-60% on average. The tab completion alone is worth the price. Combined with Claude Code for bigger architectural work, it's a serious multiplier.

**Who it's for:** Anyone who writes code, from beginners to professionals. If you're learning to code with AI, start here.

**Alternative:** GitHub Copilot (cheaper at $10/mo but less capable). Windsurf (similar concept, different approach).

---

## 5. n8n

**What it is:** Workflow automation platform. Like Zapier but way more powerful and self-hostable.

**What I pay:** Free (self-hosted)

**What I use it for:**
- Content pipeline automation (draft to publish across platforms)
- Client onboarding workflows
- Data processing and monitoring
- Connecting APIs that don't natively talk to each other
- Newsletter aggregation and processing

**Verdict:** The most underrated tool on this list. If you're paying for Zapier, you're overpaying. n8n does everything Zapier does plus you can self-host it (free), run custom code nodes, and build workflows that would cost $500/mo on Zapier for $0. The learning curve is steeper but the ceiling is much higher.

**Who it's for:** Anyone doing more than 5 automations. Business owners who want to stop paying per-task pricing. Side builders who need serious automation without serious cost.

**Alternative:** Make.com (easier UI, still powerful). Zapier (simplest but most expensive).

---

## 6. Make.com

**What it is:** Visual automation platform. Drag-and-drop workflow builder.

**What I pay:** $9/mo (Core plan)

**What I use it for:**
- Client projects where I need a hosted solution they can manage
- Quick automations that don't justify an n8n setup
- Scenarios that need reliable uptime without me managing a server

**Verdict:** The visual builder is genuinely great. For client work, it's easier to hand off than n8n because they don't need to manage infrastructure. I use both: n8n for my own stuff, Make.com for clients.

**Who it's for:** Business owners who want automation without touching a server. Anyone who tried Zapier and found it too limited or too expensive.

**Alternative:** n8n (more powerful, free self-hosted). Zapier (simpler but costlier).

---

## 7. ElevenLabs

**What it is:** AI voice generation. Text-to-speech that sounds human.

**What I pay:** $5/mo (Starter) / scales up with usage

**What I use it for:**
- Voice messages through Cortana (my AI operator)
- Audio content for tutorials and guides
- Voice cloning for consistent brand voice
- Narration for video content

**Verdict:** The voice quality is unreal. If you told me two years ago that AI voices would be this good, I wouldn't have believed it. The API is clean and fast. Voice cloning takes 30 seconds of audio and produces a usable clone.

**Who it's for:** Content creators who want audio/video without recording. Anyone building voice-enabled applications. Podcasters who want to prototype episodes.

**Alternative:** OpenAI TTS (cheaper, lower quality). Play.ht (similar quality, different pricing).

---

## 8. Notion

**What it is:** All-in-one workspace. Notes, databases, project management, wikis.

**What I pay:** $10/mo (Plus)

**What I use it for:**
- Project management across all my work
- Content planning and pipeline
- Client documentation and deliverables
- Personal knowledge base
- Financial tracking
- The AI features are decent for quick summaries and Q&A over your workspace

**Verdict:** Not strictly an "AI tool" but the AI features make it one. I run my entire life through Notion. Every project, every task, every piece of content. The database features are the real power. Notion AI is a nice bonus but not the reason to subscribe.

**Who it's for:** Anyone who needs to organize more than a few things. The free tier is solid for personal use. Paid is worth it once you need more than basic databases.

**Alternative:** Obsidian (local-first, no cloud). Airtable (better for structured data).

---

## 9. Vercel

**What it is:** Web hosting and deployment platform. Push code, get a live site.

**What I pay:** Free tier (Hobby) for most projects / Pro ($20/mo) for production apps

**What I use it for:**
- Hosting all my web applications (Retell, BookmarkIQ, landing pages)
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Serverless functions for backend logic
- Edge functions for fast global response times

**Verdict:** Deploying a website used to take hours of server configuration. Now it takes 30 seconds. Push to GitHub, Vercel deploys it. That's it. The free tier is generous enough for side projects. Pro is worth it once you have real traffic.

**Who it's for:** Anyone building web applications or sites. Even non-technical people using AI to generate sites can deploy them here instantly.

**Alternative:** Netlify (similar, slightly different feature set). Railway (better for backend-heavy apps).

---

## 10. Supabase

**What it is:** Open-source backend. Database, authentication, storage, and APIs out of the box.

**What I pay:** Free tier for development / $25/mo (Pro) for production

**What I use it for:**
- Database for Retell and other products
- User authentication (login, signup, OAuth)
- File storage
- Real-time subscriptions

**Verdict:** Supabase replaced 3-4 separate services for me. Database, auth, storage, and real-time in one platform. The Postgres foundation means your data is portable. The free tier is extremely generous for development and small projects.

**Who it's for:** Anyone building a product that needs a backend. Pairs perfectly with AI-generated frontend code. If Claude or Cursor builds your frontend, Supabase handles everything behind it.

**Alternative:** Firebase (Google's version, more lock-in). PlanetScale (database only).

---

## 11. Airtable

**What it is:** Spreadsheet-database hybrid. Like Excel but with relational data, automations, and an API.

**What I pay:** $20/mo (Team)

**What I use it for:**
- Content pipeline tracking
- Client project management
- Data collection and organization
- Connecting to n8n/Make.com for automated workflows

**Verdict:** For non-technical people who need a database, Airtable is the answer. You think in spreadsheets but get database power. The automations are limited compared to n8n, but they're dead simple to set up. The API makes it a great data layer for automation workflows.

**Who it's for:** Business owners who live in spreadsheets. Teams who need structured data without a developer. Anyone connecting data to automation workflows.

**Alternative:** Notion databases (simpler, less powerful). Google Sheets + Apps Script (free but more manual).

---

## 12. Midjourney

**What it is:** AI image generation. Creates high-quality images from text prompts.

**What I pay:** $10/mo (Basic)

**What I use it for:**
- Thumbnails and social media visuals
- Concept art for projects
- Blog and article header images
- Visual prototyping

**Verdict:** Still the best for consistent, high-quality image generation. The v6 model produces images that look like they came from a professional designer. Flux (via various providers) is catching up fast, and Google's Imagen is strong for photorealistic stuff, but Midjourney's aesthetic consistency is unmatched.

**Who it's for:** Anyone who needs visuals and doesn't have a designer. Content creators, marketers, side project builders.

**Alternative:** DALL-E via ChatGPT (more convenient, lower quality). Flux (open-source, more control). Google Imagen (photorealistic).

## The Monthly Damage

| Tool | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Claude Pro | $20 |
| ChatGPT Plus | $20 |
| Google One AI Premium | $20 |
| Cursor Pro | $20 |
| n8n | $0 (self-hosted) |
| Make.com Core | $9 |
| ElevenLabs Starter | $5 |

## If You Can Only Pick Three

1. **Claude** (or ChatGPT) -- your AI brain
2. **n8n** (or Make.com) -- your automation backbone
3. **Notion** (or Airtable) -- your organizational system

Everything else is a force multiplier on top of those three.
