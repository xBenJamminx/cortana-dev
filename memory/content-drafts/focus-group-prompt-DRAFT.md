There's a way to test your product on customers you don't have yet.

Before you ship that landing page, that pricing, that feature list. Test it against the people who'd actually buy it.

Don't have those people yet? Make the AI build them.

Steal this prompt:

"Here's what I'm working on: [describe it]. Here's what I want to test: [paste it].

Build 5 realistic customer profiles who would buy this. Then simulate each person's honest gut reaction. Rank the options."

Bonus: add "Then have them discuss it with each other like I'm not in the room" to catch things individual reactions never surface.

Your gut isn't a focus group.
