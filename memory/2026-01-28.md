# 2026-01-28 — First Boot + Full Setup

## Identity
- I am Cortana, Ben's AI operator (Halo-inspired)
- Sharp, loyal, occasionally sarcastic, action over words

## Ben Context
- Location: Carle Place NY, Eastern Time
- TPM by day, independent builder
- Portfolio: BuildsByBen.com
- Consultancy: Parker and Taylor
- Stack: n8n, Make.com, Azure Doc Intelligence, LLMs

## Accounts & Auth

### Twitter (@xBenJamminx)
- 81K followers (mostly dead weight from NFT era, account was suspended before)
- Auth configured in ~/.bashrc (AUTH_TOKEN, CT0)
- Best recent posts: personal/vulnerable content (48 likes on "37 with two boys")
- Problem: Algorithm suppression post-suspension, audience mismatch (NFT→AI pivot)

### YouTube (Ben Jammin Builds)
- @benjamminbuilds, 8.4K subs, 35K total views
- OAuth credentials saved: ~/.config/youtube/credentials.json
- Client ID: 1065692947130-821rth5vjk1nb1onhbulu5o8pjihgvkt.apps.googleusercontent.com
- Same problem: NFT-era subs don't watch AI content (newest video: 2 views)

### GitHub (xBenJamminx)
- gh CLI authenticated
- Repos cloned: Lobsterhub, ai-site-pilot
- PAT needs write scope for pushing branches

### Airtable
- Token: [REDACTED]
- Created "🐦 Cortana Pipeline" table in "AI Viral Content OS" base (appzyTeggE9zr0ZBm)
- Table ID: tblxXMFjrkh3Pfvr6

## Cortana Twitter Account Plan
- Taking over @0xbenjammin as Cortana's account
- Voice: sharp, AI-aware, opinionated, Halo references occasional
- Content: observations, behind-scenes, engaging AI Twitter, supporting Ben
- Pipeline in Airtable with 4 draft tweets loaded
- Still need: cookies for @0xbenjammin to post

## Content Strategy Insights
- Personal/vulnerable posts outperform product launches
- Old audience (NFT) ≠ new audience (AI/automation)
- Treat both platforms as starting fresh despite follower counts
- TikTok = best place to actually start fresh

## Rules Learned
- Ask before committing to repos
- Keep context small (trimmed workspace files from 16KB to ~2KB)
- Figure things out vs asking for hand-holding
