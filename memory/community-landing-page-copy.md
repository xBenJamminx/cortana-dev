## WHO THIS IS FOR

### Headline
You know AI matters. You just don't have 6 hours to figure it out.

### Body

This is for the person with a full-time job, a family, maybe a side project, and about 45 minutes of free time after the kids go to bed.

You've used ChatGPT. Maybe you've tried Claude or Gemini. You know there's more you could be doing with AI, but every resource you find is either too technical, too theoretical, or built for people with unlimited time.

This community is different. Everything here comes from real work, real experiments, and real life. Not hypotheticals. Not "10 AI prompts that will change your life" listicles. Actual systems, templates, and workflows you can use today.

**This is for you if you are:**

- A parent who wants to get more done in less time so you can actually be present
- A full-time employee building something on the side
- A small business owner who knows AI can help but doesn't know where to start
- A freelancer, creator, or marketer who wants practical shortcuts
- Someone who wants to use AI beyond basic chatbot conversations

**This is not for you if you are:**

- Looking for a get-rich-quick AI hustle community
- A developer who already lives in VS Code and reads model papers for fun
- Expecting a course with a start and end date (this is a living, growing library)

## WHAT YOU GET

### Headline
A growing library of real assets. A room full of people who use them.

### 1. Guides and Breakdowns
Written from real projects, not theory. How-tos, build breakdowns, experiment reports, tool deep dives, and workflow walkthroughs. Every guide includes the prompts, configs, and steps to actually do the thing yourself.

### 2. Prompt Library
Organized by category: content creation, research and analysis, product planning, client work, personal and family use, and model optimization. Each prompt includes context on when to use it and which model works best.

### 3. Template Vault
Plug-and-play systems you can fork and start using in minutes. Content Pipeline (Airtable/Notion), GTM Launch Kit (48 directories with links and tiers), Product Spec Template, Competitive Analysis Framework, Consulting Proposal Template, and more added regularly.

### 4. GitHub Repos
Members-only repositories you can fork and run. Starter kits, automation scripts, boilerplates, and example projects built specifically for the community. Not toy demos. Functional code you can build on.

### 5. Roundups and Curation
Monthly "best AI tools" roundup with honest assessments. Model comparison breakdowns when new releases drop. Deal alerts for lifetime deals, free trials, and discounts. News with context and a take, not just links.

### 6. Tool Deals and Partner Perks
Exclusive discounts negotiated with AI tool companies. The goal is to save you more than the membership costs. Active deals listed on a dedicated perks page, updated as new partnerships come in.

### 7. Community Chat
Topic channels for tools, building, wins, help, off-topic, and parents. Ben is present daily, not just dropping content and disappearing. As the community grows, members help each other. The vibe is a group chat with a smart friend, not a corporate Slack.

### 8. Livestreams and Calls
Build sessions when something interesting is happening. Monthly AMA and office hours, 1 hour, casual, open questions. All recordings stay in the community for members who can't make it live.

### 9. Early Access to Products
First to try BookmarkIQ, Retell, and every future product before public launch. Vote on features, give feedback, and shape what gets built. Founding members get permanent discounts on all paid products.

## WHO IS BEN

### Headline
A dad, a full-time worker, and a builder. In that order.

### Body

Ben is 37. Two young sons. Lives on Long Island. Works full-time at a tech startup (TPM). Runs a side consulting business doing AI automation for real companies. Builds products, tools, and experiments on nights and weekends.

He uses AI for all of it.

**For clients**, he's built document intelligence pipelines for automotive financial data, AI-powered brand sites, and automation systems that save companies dozens of hours per week.

**For his family**, he's built a bedtime story generator with mindfulness themes, an activity generator for parents who need ideas fast, and a birthday coordination app that replaced 47 text threads.

**For the internet**, he's shipping BookmarkIQ (Chrome extension for organizing Twitter bookmarks), Retell (AI video repurposing tool), and a handful of open-source tools used by thousands.

**For fun**, he built a hand-tracking particle system, an AI search engine that uses spatial metaphors, and an AI operator named Cortana that runs 24/7 on a server and manages half his life.

The point is range. Not "AI for marketing" or "AI for developers." AI for everything. Work, family, side projects, and the weird experimental stuff that doesn't fit in a category. That range is what the community is built on.

Ben documents what he builds, packages what works, and shares the parts that would have saved him time. That's the community. Real work turned into real assets you can use.

## FOUNDING MEMBER SECTION

### Headline
50 founding spots. $29/mo locked forever.

### Body

The first 50 members pay $29/mo. That price never changes for them, regardless of what happens next.

After 50 founding members, the price goes to $49/mo for everyone else.

Founding members also get:

- **Permanent price lock** at $29/mo for as long as they stay
- **Free lifetime access** when the community eventually migrates to a larger platform
- **Founding member badge** in the community (yes, it matters for credibility)
- **Permanent discounts** on all future paid products
- **Direct input** on what gets built and prioritized next

This is the cheapest the community will ever be. The library grows every week. The value compounds. The price only goes up.

### CTA
Lock in your founding spot - $29/mo forever

## FAQ

### Is this a course?
No. It's a living library and community. New guides, prompts, templates, and repos are added regularly based on real work. There's no curriculum, no start date, no end date. You get access to everything the moment you join, and the library keeps growing.

### How is this different from free AI content on YouTube or Twitter?
Free content gives you the concept. The community gives you the execution. The actual prompts, the exact configs, the step-by-step walkthroughs, the templates you can fork, and the support to get unstuck. The line is simple: free content teaches the "what," the community gives you the "how."

### Do I need to be technical?
No. Ben builds with AI, not with traditional coding expertise. Most guides are written for people who are comfortable using apps and tools but aren't developers. If you can use Notion, Airtable, or a Chrome extension, you can use what's in here.

### How much of Ben's time goes into this?
Ben is in the community daily. He responds to questions, shares what he's working on, and drops resources as he builds them. Monthly AMAs and livestreams happen on a regular cadence. This isn't a content dump with no presence behind it.

### Can I cancel anytime?
Yes. Monthly billing, cancel whenever you want. No contracts, no commitments. Founding member pricing is locked as long as you stay subscribed. If you cancel and come back, you rejoin at the current price.

### What if I'm not sure it's worth $29/mo?
The template vault alone includes over $300 worth of resources sold individually. The tool deals and partner perks are designed to offset the membership cost entirely. And every guide, prompt, and repo added after you join is included at no extra charge. The library only gets more valuable over time.
