## Major Change: Switched to Claude Max Subscription

Ben configured Cortana to use his Claude Max subscription instead of OpenRouter API credits.

### What Changed
- Primary model: `claude-cli/opus` (was `openrouter/gemini-flash`)
- Backend: Claude Code CLI with `-p --output-format json`
- Auth: Credentials synced from Ben's local ~/.claude/.credentials.json
- Cost: $0 per token (covered by Max subscription)

### Technical Setup
1. Copied Claude Code credentials to /root/.claude/.credentials.json
2. Configured cliBackends in openclaw.json (removed --dangerously-skip-permissions for root)
3. Set model to `claude-cli/opus` with haiku and gemini-flash fallbacks
4. Created CLAUDE.md for identity loading

### Files Updated
- CLAUDE.md (new) - Main identity loader
- AGENTS.md - Removed Kimi/@pro routing, updated to reflect Opus
- memory/integrations.md - Updated provider status

### TOS Note
Using Max subscription for bot automation is gray area. Keep usage moderate, don't share bot publicly.

## Bird CLI Working
- AUTH_TOKEN and CT0 configured in ~/.bashrc
- Can search X/Twitter: `bird search "from:xBenJamminx"`

## Server Access
- Removed ben user, now root-only SSH
- `ssh openclaw` connects as root directly
