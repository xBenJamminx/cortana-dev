**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Purpose:** Inform BuildsByBen community/membership pricing, positioning, and product decisions

---

## 1. TOP AI COMMUNITIES & MEMBERSHIPS

### A. Skool Communities (AI-Focused)

| Community | Leader | Members | Price | Est. Revenue |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **AI Automation Society** (Free) | Nate Herk | 239K+ | Free | $0 (funnel top) |
| **AI Automation Society Plus** | Nate Herk | 3,100 | $94/mo or $799/yr | ~$291K/mo MRR ($3-4M ARR) |
| **The AI Advantage** | Igor Pogany | ~5K+ | $20/mo (rising) | Est. $100K+/mo |
| **Vibe Coding Academy** | Alex Finn | Growing | $49/mo (VIP lifetime $100) | New, scaling fast |
| **I Heart AI** | AI Leadership Institute | 1.9K | Free | Lead gen for consulting |
| **AI Automations by Jack** | Jack | Smaller | Paid (price varies) | Unknown |
| **Liam Ottley AAA Accelerator** | Liam Ottley | 15.7K (Skool) | $1,500-$7,150 (one-time) | High-ticket cohort model |

**Key pattern:** The biggest money is in the freemium funnel. Nate Herk has 239K free members converting at ~1.3% to $94/mo. That 1.3% generates $3-4M/yr.

### B. AI Newsletters with Paid Tiers

| Newsletter | Subscribers | Free? | Paid Tier | Paid Price | Primary Revenue |
|------------|------------|-------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **The Rundown AI** | 2M+ | Yes | No paid tier | N/A | Sponsorships ($1,749/main ad) |
| **Superhuman AI** (Zain Kahn) | 1M+ | Yes | No paid tier | N/A | Sponsorships ($1.5M+/yr, 6-fig/mo) |
| **TLDR AI** | 1.25M+ | Yes | No paid tier | N/A | Sponsorships |
| **Ben's Bites** | 140K+ | Yes | Pro tier | $150/yr ($250 full price) | Subs + sponsorships |
| **Alex Finn (Ship/It Weekly)** | Growing | Yes | 1% Club | Substack paid | Subs + academy upsell |

**Key insight:** The mega-newsletters (Rundown, Superhuman, TLDR) make ALL their money from ads, not paid subscribers. They chose scale over direct monetization. Ben's Bites is the exception -- smaller but monetizes directly with Pro at $150/yr.

### C. AI Course Platforms

| Platform/Creator | Model | Price Range | What They Sell |
|-----------------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Skill Leap AI** (Futurepedia) | Subscription | $25-30/mo or $240/yr | 30+ AI tool courses, prompt libraries, cheat sheets |
| **God of Prompt** | One-time + Sub | $17/mo or $150 lifetime | 30,000+ prompts, how-to guides, n8n workflows |
| **Udemy (Prompt Engineering)** | One-time | $10-15 (sale price) | Individual courses, certificates |
| **Liam Ottley AAA** | Cohort | $1,500-$7,150 | 60+ hrs video, templates, weekly Q&A, community |

### D. Prompt Marketplaces

| Platform | Prompts Listed | Price Per Prompt | Commission | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| **PromptBase** | 240K+ | $1.99-$9.99 | 20% (platform takes) | Largest marketplace; new sellers capped at $4.99 |
| **God of Prompt** | 30,000+ | Bundle model ($150 lifetime) | N/A (direct sales) | Claims $40K/mo revenue |
| **Gumroad sellers** | Varies | $5-$50 per pack | 10% (Gumroad fee) | Niche packs (100-500 prompts) |
| **Etsy sellers** | Growing | $7-$15 per template | Etsy fees | n8n workflows, AI prompt packs |

### E. YouTube AI Educators with Paid Offerings

| Creator | YouTube Subs | Paid Offering | Price |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| **Nate Herk** | 440K+ | AIS+ Skool community | $94/mo |
| **Matt Wolfe** | 460K+ | Newsletter (170K), FutureTools.io | Free (ad-supported) |
| **Skill Leap AI** (Futurepedia) | 2M+ across channels | Skill Leap subscription | $25-30/mo |
| **Igor Pogany** (AI Advantage) | 800K+ | AI Advantage Skool | $20/mo |
| **Alex Finn** | 100K+ | Vibe Coding Academy | $49/mo |
| **Liam Ottley** | 300K+ | AAA Accelerator | $1,500-$7,150 |

### F. Other Platforms (Whop, Patreon, Discord)

| Platform | Notable AI Offerings | Pricing |
|----------|---------------------|---------|
| **Whop** | Mostly trading/crypto bots with AI. Limited pure AI education. | $49-$129/mo for trading communities |
| **Patreon** | AI art creators (small), no dominant AI education presence | $5-$50/mo tiers |
| **Discord** | "Learn AI Together" (free, 30M+ AI users on Discord) | Mostly free; paid via external links |

**Key insight:** Whop dominates trading/ecom, not AI education. Patreon is losing ground to Skool for community-based education. Discord is where free AI communities live but monetization happens elsewhere.

## 4. THE GAP -- WHAT'S MISSING

### Gap 1: The "Builder Who Ships" Community (Not Beginner, Not Agency)
**Problem:** Almost every AI community targets one of two extremes:
- Complete beginners ("What is ChatGPT?")
- People building agencies ("How to sell AI automation to clients")

**Missing:** The solo builder/indie hacker who uses AI tools to build and ship their OWN products. Someone building a SaaS, a Chrome extension, a side project -- not selling services to clients. This is the BuildsByBen sweet spot.

**Evidence:** Indie Worldwide charges $290/yr for this vibe but doesn't focus on AI. Vibe Coding Academy is the closest competitor but is brand new and narrowly focused on Claude Code.

### Gap 2: Practical "Build Along" Content (Not Tutorial Hell)
**Problem:** 78% of enterprises have adopted AI tools, but only 6% of employees feel comfortable using them. Most AI courses are either "way too basic or ridiculously long." The market is flooded with "intro to ChatGPT" content.

**Missing:** Structured "build this specific thing" content where the learner ships something real. Not "here's how prompting works" but "here's how I built a $300K/yr app with Claude Code, follow along and build yours."

**Evidence:** Alex Finn's Vibe Coding Academy guarantees you ship an app in 28 days. This outcome-based framing is rare and clearly resonating.

### Gap 3: Multi-Tool Workflow Integration
**Problem:** Most communities are single-tool focused (n8n, Claude Code, Make.com). Real builders use 5-10 tools together.

**Missing:** Content that teaches the full stack -- "here's how I use Claude + n8n + Supabase + Vercel together to ship a product." Integration workflows, not isolated tool tutorials.

**Evidence:** Ben's actual stack (n8n, Make.com, Azure Doc Intelligence, LLMs, Claude Code) is the real-world multi-tool approach that nobody teaches cohesively.

### Gap 4: "Show Your Work" Transparency
**Problem:** Most AI educators create polished courses ABOUT building. Few show the messy reality of building in public.

**Missing:** Raw build logs, real revenue numbers, actual failure stories. Content that says "here's exactly what I built this week, what broke, what I learned, and here's the template so you can do it too."

**Evidence:** Alex Finn model works because he builds real things and extracts insights. But nobody combines this with a structured community + downloadable assets.

### Gap 5: Non-Developer AI Education
**Problem:** The "AI skills gap" is a $5.5 trillion problem (IDC). 78% of enterprises adopted AI tools but most employees can't use them effectively. Existing education targets either developers or complete novices.

**Missing:** Practical AI education for knowledge workers, small business owners, and creative professionals who aren't developers but want to use AI tools productively. Not "learn to code with AI" but "use AI to 10x your existing work."

### Gap 6: Curated, Updated Resource Libraries (Not Static Packs)
**Problem:** Prompt packs go stale. AI tools change monthly. A static PDF of prompts from 6 months ago is already outdated.

**Missing:** A living, continuously updated resource library -- prompt libraries that evolve with new models, workflow templates that get updated when tools change, tool recommendation guides that stay current.

**Evidence:** God of Prompt advertises "weekly updates" as a selling point. Skill Leap promises "all new courses monthly." The market clearly values freshness.

## 5. BUILDSBYBEN OPPORTUNITY MAP

### What Ben Can Uniquely Offer
1. **Real builder credibility** -- Actually shipping products (Retell doing revenue), not just teaching theory
2. **Multi-tool integration** -- n8n + Make + LLMs + Azure + Claude Code stack knowledge
3. **TPM mindset** -- Systems thinking, project management, shipping discipline
4. **Father/builder lifestyle angle** -- "Build on the side of life" resonates with a massive audience
5. **Transparency** -- Real numbers, real build logs, real failures

### Recommended Positioning
**"The community for people who build with AI, not just learn about it."**

Not beginners. Not agency builders. Builders who ship their own things.

### Suggested Pricing Framework
| Tier | Price | What's In It |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Free** (Skool or newsletter) | $0 | Weekly builds, templates, community discussion |
| **Builder's Pass** | $29-49/mo | Full template library (n8n workflows, prompts, cheat sheets), build-along tutorials, live Q&A, community |
| **Annual** | $299-399/yr | Everything above + premium courses + partner deals + price lock |
| **One-Time Packs** (Gumroad) | $19-49 each | Niche prompt packs, specific workflow bundles, tool comparison guides |

### Key Deliverables to Build
1. **Living template library** -- n8n workflows, prompt collections, tool configs (updated monthly)
2. **Weekly "Build Log"** -- What Ben built, what broke, what shipped, downloadable assets
3. **"Build This" tutorials** -- Step-by-step project builds with real outcomes
4. **Tool stack guides** -- Multi-tool integration walkthroughs (not single-tool tutorials)
5. **Prompt library** -- Organized by use case (content creation, development, automation, business)
