# The GTM Launch Kit: 75+ Places to Launch Your SaaS or Chrome Extension

**The complete directory of platforms, communities, and channels to maximize your product launch.**

---

## How to Use This Kit

Launching a product is not a single event. It is a campaign spread across weeks. Here is how to get maximum impact from this list:

1. **Submit in tier order.** Tier 1 sites drive the most traffic and credibility. Start there.
2. **Space your launches.** Do not submit everywhere on the same day. Stagger across 2-4 weeks so each platform gives you a fresh wave of traffic.
3. **Prepare assets first.** Before submitting anywhere, have these ready:
   - One-liner description (under 60 characters)
   - Short description (1-2 sentences, under 240 characters)
   - Long description (2-3 paragraphs)
   - 4-6 high-quality screenshots or a demo GIF
   - Logo (square, at least 512x512)
   - Founder headshot
   - Launch video or demo (60-90 seconds, optional but powerful)
   - Pricing page live
   - A working product (most directories require this)
4. **Track everything.** Create a spreadsheet with: Site Name, Date Submitted, Status (Pending/Live/Rejected), URL of Listing, Traffic Driven.
5. **Engage after submitting.** Respond to every comment. Upvote and comment on other launches. The algorithm rewards engagement on most platforms.
6. **Coordinate social with directory launches.** When your Product Hunt goes live, post on X, LinkedIn, and communities simultaneously for compounding momentum.
